<p>
When I think about the present - about us — my heart feels full. We have created so many beautiful moments together. The laughter we share, the silly jokes, the random conversations that turn into memories… these are the things that make my days brighter. Being with you feels like home, like peace, like happiness I never knew I needed so deeply.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sometimes we fight. Sometimes we misunderstand each other. Sometimes we both make mistakes. But what I love the most about us is that we never let those moments break us. We talk. We solve. We understand. We come back stronger every single time. Our arguments don't define us — the way we fix them does. And that shows how much we truly care.
</p>

<p>
I'm so proud of the way we support each other's passions and dreams. Seeing you grow, seeing you chase what you love, makes me genuinely happy. I will always stand beside you, cheering for you, believing in you — even on days when you doubt yourself.
</p>

<p>
I know sometimes I give you long lectures. Sometimes I become strict. Sometimes I get angry. And for that, I'm truly sorry. Please understand that it never comes from ego or control — it comes from love and concern. I want the best for you in everything. I want your health to be perfect, your body strong, your mind peaceful. When I tell you to exercise or follow a good diet, it's not to pressure you — it's because I want you to live a long, healthy, beautiful life. I want us to grow old together without regrets.
</p>

<p>
Even when I get angry, I always try to understand your feelings. Your emotions matter to me. Your tears matter. Your happiness matters. You matter. More than my anger. More than my pride. More than anything.
</p>

<p>
If I'm strict sometimes, it's because I care deeply. If I correct you, it's because I see your potential. If I push you, it's because I believe you deserve the best version of yourself. But above all of that, please remember this — I love you. Not conditionally. Not temporarily. Not only when things are perfect. I love you in the happy moments, in the messy moments, in the silent moments, and even in our difficult ones.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being my partner in laughter, in growth, in lessons, and in love. Our present is beautiful because we are building it together.
