<p>
I know your past has not been easy. There were moments filled with pain, loneliness, and battles you had to fight on your own. I often think about those times and wish I could have been there beside you — to protect you, to hold your hand, to wipe away your tears, and to remind you that you deserved so much better.
</p>

<p>
But the past is only a time that has already gone. It cannot return, and it cannot hurt you the same way again unless we let it. What matters now is the present — and in your present, I am here.
</p>

<p>
You are not alone anymore. You don't have to be strong all the time by yourself. If tears come, let them come — but let them fall on my shoulder. If fears return, let me face them with you. From this moment forward, I want to be the peace you were missing before.
</p>

<p>
I may not have been there in your past, and that will always be something I regret. But I promise you this with all my heart — I am here now, and I will stand by you for the rest of my life. Through every smile, every struggle, every memory we create together.
</p>

<p>
Your past does not define you. It only shows how strong you are. And I am so proud of you.
</p>

With all my love,<br>
